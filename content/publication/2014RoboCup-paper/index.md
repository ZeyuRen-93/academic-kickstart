abstract: The Small Size League is one of the important events in RoboCup Soccer. ZJUNlict got the first place in Robocup 2014. In this paper, we introduce the improvement we have made in the past year. We describe the overview of the mechanical design, show the design of the protector for Infrared emission tube as well as the shield for wheels. Simulation is given to show how our design works. Then the lower level firmware architecture is illustrated. The dynamics analysis of the robot is presented to help improving the robotsâ€™ performance and reducing motion deviation in y axis. Finally we present how we organize defense employing Close-Marking defense along with Zone defense imitating human player.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
