abstract: This paper introduces the design of a novel under-actuated hand with highly integrated modular finger units, which can be easily reconfigured in terms of finger arrangement and number to account for the manipulation needs of different applications. Each finger module is powered by a single actuator through an under-actuated transmission and equipped with a sensory system for delicate and precise grasping, which includes absolute position measurements, contact pressure sensing at finger phalanxes and motor current readings. Finally, intrinsic elasticity integrated in the transmission system make the hand robust and adaptive to impacts when interacting with the objects and environment. This highly integrated hand (HERI II) was developed for the Centauro Robot to enable robust and resilient manipulation. A set of experiments demonstrating the hand's grasping performance were carried out and fully verified the design effectiveness of the proposed hand.
