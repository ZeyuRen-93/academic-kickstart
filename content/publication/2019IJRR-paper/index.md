abstract: We present the development, modeling, and control of a three-degree-of-freedom compliantly actuated leg called the eLeg, which employs both series- and parallel-elastic actuation as well as a bio-inspired biarticular tendon. The leg can be reconfigured to use three distinct actuation configurations, to directly compare with a state-of-the-art series-elastic actuation scheme. Critical actuation design parameters are derived through optimization. A rigorous modeling approach is presented using the concept of power flows, which are also used to demonstrate the ability to transfer mechanical power between ankle and knee joints using the biarticular tendon. The design principles and control strategies were verified both in simulation and experiment. Notably, the experimental data demonstrate significant improvements of 65â€“75% in electrical energy consumption compared with a state-of-the-art series-elastic actuator configuration.
