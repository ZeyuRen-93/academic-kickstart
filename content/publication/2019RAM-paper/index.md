abstract: Mobile manipulation robots have great potential for roles in support of rescuers on disaster-response missions. Robots can operate in places too dangerous for humans and therefore can assist in accomplishing hazardous tasks while their human operators work at a safe distance. We developed a disaster-response system that consists of the highly flexible Centauro robot and suitable control interfaces, including an immersive telepresence suit and support-operator controls offering different levels of autonomy.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
