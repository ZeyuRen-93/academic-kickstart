abstract: Torque distribution in redundant robots that combine the potential of asymmetric series-parallel actuated branches and multi-articulation pose a non-trivial challenge. To address the problem, this work proposes a novel optimization based controller that can accommodate various quadratic criteria to perform the torque distribution among dissimilar series and parallel actuators in order to maximize the motion efficiency. Three candidate criteria are composed and their performances are compared during periodic squat motions with a 3 degree of freedom series-parallel compliant articulated leg prototype. It is first shown that by minimizing a criterion that takes into account the actuator hardware specifications such as torque constant and transmission ratio, the gravity-driven phases can be lengthened. Thereby, this particular criterion results in slightly better performance than when adopting a strategy that maximizes the torque allocation to the higher efficiency actuators. Furthermore, valuable insights such as that the efficacy of maximum utilization of the highly-efficient parallel actuation branches decreases progressively at high frequencies were observed.
